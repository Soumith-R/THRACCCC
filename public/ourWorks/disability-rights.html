          <p>
            The government has proposed 108 amendments to the Persons with
            Disabilities Act, the overarching disability legislation in India.
            Disabled rights groups are demanding a new law instead that would
            guarantee civil and political rights to disabled people and expand
            the definition of disability.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment of the Government of
            India has been holding national consultative meetings on proposed
            amendments to the Persons with Disabilities Equal Opportunities,
            Protection of Rights and Full Participation Act (PWD Act). Meetings
            have been held in Delhi, Guwahati and most recently in Kolkata on
            March 13, 2010. The debate centres on whether there should be
            amendments to the existing law, or whether there should be a new law.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Persons with Disabilities Equal Opportunities, Protection of
            Rights and Full Participation Act, (PWD Act) of 1995 had heralded a
            new dawn in the lives of disabled people in India. For the first time
            in the history of independent India, a separate law had been
            formulated which talked about the multiple needs of disabled people.
            Very soon, though, activists as well as disabled people felt that the
            law had too many loopholes. However, this Act did help disabled
            people to come together, forming groups as they started making
            demands to implement this law.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the delight of disability groups, India ratified the UN Convention
            on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (Disability Convention) in
            October 2007. This Convention marks a formal shift from the archaic
            medical model to the social model, and promotes the rights of people
            living with disabilities. Article 1 encapsulates the overall
            objective of the Convention which is "to promote, protect and ensure
            the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental
            freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for
            their inherent dignity."
          </p>
          <p>
            The Convention recognises that persons with disability are
            right-holders instead of passive recipients of government schemes. In
            contrast, the PWD Act has a different foundation. The PWD Act was
            enacted in order to implement the Proclamation on the Full
            Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the
            Asia-Pacific Region. The PWD Act does not expressly recognise rights,
            but laid emphasis on the need to eliminate physical and social
            barriers so as to promote the participation of people living with
            disabilities. The PWD Act, thus, does not internalise any of the core
            principles that form the bedrock of the Disability Convention.
          </p>

          <h3>Retain or recast?</h3>
          <p>
            There is a definite need to review the existing legislative framework
            in India to examine whether it adequately promotes the rights
            contained in the Convention. The Disability Convention imposes two
            key legislative obligations: (1) to ensure that the rights contained
            in the Convention are realised and (2) to ensure that existing laws
            and practices that are discriminatory towards people living with
            disabilities are repealed or amended to bring them in line with the
            Convention.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since its ratification by India, there has been much discussion of
            the manner in which Indian laws must be modified or harmonised to
            give effect to the obligations under the Convention. While the
            Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MOSJE) has proposed 108
            amendments to the PWD Act including 50 new provisions, the Disabled
            Rights Group (DRG) led by Javed Abidi has unequivocally stated that
            the PWD Act has served its time and that there is a need for a new
            law.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consultations on this issue at national and zonal levels are going on
            throughout India right now. Advocate Kanchan Pamnani, who is blind
            herself, says that the old law will need more than 300 amendments to
            make it suitable to our times, and obviously it is better to frame a
            new one than make 300 changes in the old one. Shukla Bhadury, mother
            of two disabled children agrees. She says it is ridiculous that
            government is even considering so many amendments. "Even in the
            amendments, punitive actions are not mentioned," comments Sritama, a
            law student and member of Campaigners for Inclusion. "Any law
            without punitive action will not work in this country," she says.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's examine the differences between the Disability Convention and
            the present PWD Act to see why such passionate pleas to repeal this
            law are coming from all quarters.
          </p>

          <h3>Purpose</h3>
          <p>
            It is clear from the objectives of the Convention that civil and
            political rights and economic, social and cultural rights stand on
            the same footing and that the state must make efforts to realise
            both. The PWD Act barely provides for civil and political rights and
            the amendments proposed by the MOSJE, too, neglect these rights.
          </p>

          <h3>Construction of disability</h3>
          <p>
            The PWD Act adopts a narrow definition of disability and confines it
            to "blindness; low vision; leprosy-cured; hearing impairment;
            locomotor disability; mental retardation; and mental illness". As
            opposed to this, the Disability Convention recognises that
            "disability is an evolving concept" and avoids listing specific
            conditions and severities and broadly casts "persons with
            disabilities" to "include those who have long-term physical, mental,
            intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various
            barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society
            on an equal basis with others."
          </p>

          <h3>Foundational principles (Article 3)</h3>
          <p>
            The core human rights principles stated in Article 3 of the
            Disability Convention are respect for inherent dignity and individual
            autonomy; non-discrimination, full and effective participation and
            inclusion, respect for difference; equality of opportunity;
            accessibility; gender equality; respect for the evolving capacity of
            children with disabilities and their right to preserve their
            identities." These general principles have been well etched in
            several provisions of the Convention.
          </p>
          <p>
            The amendments proposed by the MOSJE merely replicate Article 3
            without incorporating the provisions which further the principles
            such as those relating to civil and political rights, rights of women
            and girls with disabilities, and several other rights stated below.
          </p>

          <h3>Extent of application (Article 4(1)(e))</h3>
          <p>
            The Disability Convention requires the state to address discrimination
            on the basis of disability even in the private sector. The amendments
            proposed to the chapter on discrimination fail to expressly prohibit
            discrimination on the basis of disability or spell out the
            consequences for the same.
          </p>

          <h3>Recognised rights</h3>
          <p>
            The Disability Convention expressly recognises the following rights:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Right to equality and non-discrimination. It also recognises the
              need to provide for reasonable accommodation in order to further
              the right to equality.
            </li>
            <li>
              Right of women and girls with disabilities to full and equal
              enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Right of children with disabilities to full and equal enjoyment of
              all human rights and fundamental freedoms. A child's right to
              express views on matters affecting him/her is also recognised.
            </li>
            <li>
              Right to access to the physical environment, to transportation, to
              information and communications, including information and
              communications technologies and systems, in urban and rural areas.
            </li>
            <li>Right to life.</li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              Right to recognition before law. The right to legal capacity is
              also included.
            </li>
            <li>
              Right to access justice with procedural and age-appropriate
              accommodations.
            </li>
            <li>Right to liberty and security of person.</li>
            <li>
              Right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
              or punishment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Protection from exploitation, violation and abuse, gender-based and
              otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>Right to respect for physical and mental integrity.</li>
            <li>
              Right to freedom of movement and the right to acquire and change a
              nationality.
            </li>
            <li>
              Right to live in the community and choose place of residence.
            </li>
            <li>Right to freedom of expression.</li>
            <li>Right to privacy.</li>
            <li>Right to marry and found a family.</li>
            <li>
              Right to retain fertility and other reproductive rights.
            </li>
            <li>Right to education.</li>
            <li>
              Right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prohibition on discrimination on the basis of disability in
              employment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Right to an adequate standard of living including adequate food,
              clothing, and housing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Right to participate in political and public life including the
              right to vote and to be elected.
            </li>
            <li>Right to participate in cultural life.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While most of the above rights can be gleaned from the Indian
            Constitution, a glance at the existing PWD Act shows that it can
            hardly be termed a rights-based legislation. It recognises only the
            right to education, provides for reservations in employment and for
            half-hearted measures to reduce physical barriers. It also prohibits
            establishments from discriminating against an employee because of
            his/her disability.
          </p>
          <p>
            These abovementioned rights must be codified in the form of a statute
            that is more likely to be invoked by people living with disabilities.
            The amendments proposed by the MOSJE fail to provide for a majority
            of civil and political rights such as the right to recognition before
            law, right to privacy, right to marry, right against torture etc.
            Discrimination has been addressed only in transport and in-built
            environment. Clause 46A (2) of the proposed amendments leaves it to
            the government to frame 'policies' to ensure equal access to
            education, health, employment and other public services. It fails to
            expressly prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further, the rights that appear in the PWD Act do not measure up to
            the standards set out in the Convention. For instance, Sections 44-46
            of the PWD Act require establishments and the government to take
            "special measures" to enable people with disabilities to gain better
            access to public transport, buildings, and roads. However, such
            measures could be undertaken only if it were "within the limits of
            their economic capacity". A mere deletion of these words without
            fleshing out the obligation will be unfruitful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without a strong implementation mechanism, the few rights that have
            been added on will be deprived of meaning. For instance, the Act
            empowers the Disability Commissioner to "recommend" necessary action
            to appropriate authorities in order to address "deprivation of
            rights". This recommendation is of no binding value and the authority
            can reject it thus rendering the office of the Commissioner toothless
            as before.
          </p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            The PWD Act will require a complete overhaul. The Act must be recast
            to comprehensively provide for all the rights recognised under the
            Convention. In a letter to the minister of social justice and
            empowerment, (http://uncrpdandlaw.nilsingsit.org/blog/letter-to-hon-ble-minister-for-social-justice-and-empowerment)
            the Disability Rights Group has said that the amendments proposed by
            the ministry do not mirror the rights-based framework of the
            Convention. In the past, the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of
            Children) Act, 2000 to give effect to India's obligation under the UN
            Convention on the Rights of the Child, was re-enacted in the form of
            the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
            Involvement of stakeholders is inherent in a rights-based approach
            and their exclusion will be discordant with the soul and spirit of
            the Disability Convention. The form that the harmonisation should
            take must be thoroughly discussed and debated in consultation with
            various stakeholders and the government cannot afford to take the
            decision unilaterally.
          </p>
          <p>
            With strong voices rising from within the disability sector, can the
            state remain inattentive to this demand? "It's the decision of the
            ministry to force down their opinion on us anymore, whatever comes,"
            says Rajarshi Chakrobarti, Secretary of Swabalamban, a West
            Bengal-based organization with more than 1,500 disabled members.
